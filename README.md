# Timesheet
Decision choices:
  * The job codes submitted by the worker on same date will come as multiple entries in the log sheet.
  * The Supervisor can see the all the jobs submitted under one date and then approve for that date
  * Supervisor needs to enter the Worker name he wants to view logsheet
  
The credentials can be seen from seeds.exs
example: 
username: supervisee4
password: password6

username: supervisor2
password: password5
